THIS IS A BASIC IDEA OF THE FORMATTING OF A LEXICON

the whole thing is based around the == sign, like this:
<option>> <what you say> = <comand> <args>

---OPTION and WHAT YOU SAY---
"what you say" will be a phrase to look for, while "option" will be how to look for it

there will be several different options:


v - verbatum - you HAVE to say whatever there is, no more, no less:

ex:
v> hello = say "hi"
this will only return "hi" if you EXACTLY say hello


c - contains - will run the command if what you say contains at least one instance of a term

ex:
c> hello = say "hi"
this will return "hi" if you say "hello", "hello, how are you," or "asdfsdgasdhello" since they all contain the phrase "hello"


s - starts with - will run the command only if what you say STARTS with the following phrase

ex:
s> hello = say "hi"
this will return "hi" if you type in "Hello," "hello, how are you," or "HELLOsdfgasdf," but not "well, hello there," or "asdfasdfghello"

e - ends with - (not finished)

--COMMANDS--

"command" will specify what to do, and each command has different "args" or arguments


say - returns a specific string:
